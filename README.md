Grounded Console Commands

This Python tool was made to make it easier to access console commands for Grounded by Obsidian Entertainment.

Using Universal Unreal Unlocker 4(UUU), a player can hook into the process(Maine) of the running game and use
certain commands to improve their character or summon blueprints.

This is not intended to be a guide for the use of UUU, but a tool to be used alongside it.

This tool does NOT contain all of the summonable items.  I felt there were way too many and didn't want the tool
to get too convoluted, kind of like this readme.

It does have all of the creatures and all the main ingredients to make your character stronger.
Armor and Weapons were omitted.  After more testing, some may be added to the tool.

If this tool is missing an item you want, you may request it or use Unreal Model Viewer to locate it.

Use of the Tool:

-Make sure UUU is already running properly on your game.

-Pick the category of the blueprint you are looking for then find the blueprint in the 2nd drop box.

-Type in your desired quantity of items or leave as 1(careful when spawning a lot, especially bugs, it gets crazy)

-Click the "Copy to Clipboard" button, this copies the desired quantity of console commands to the clipboard

-In game, type `` followed by CTRL+V to past in the commands then hit ENTER.

Enjoy the loot and have fun smashing bugs my friends!
